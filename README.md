# Guess The Phrase! Game
This was the project #6 of the [Treehouse Front End Web Development Techdegree](https://teamtreehouse.com/techdegree/front-end-web-development-2). <br>
Mobile experience is not in scope of this project, so please view the page at desktop width. No library was used in this project. <br><br>
At this point I am already very comfortable with utilizing jQuery and it's plugins. Vanilla js always looks terrifying to me, but thanks to the awesome javascript teacher Guil at Treehouse, I got a grasp on vanilla js quickly. This game is written entirely in vanilla js for the sake of practicing. 
I also digged into css animation a little bit in this project, and found it incredibly fun!

## Instruction From Treehouse
> In this project, you'll create a word guessing game. Players will click letters from an onscreen keyboard to try to guess a random phrase. The player’s goal is to guess all the letters in the phrase. A player can keep choosing letters until they make five incorrect guesses. Letters guessed correctly will appear in the phrase. Letters guessed incorrectly will be counted at the bottom of the screen. 

## Starter Content From Treehouse
- Basic markup (.html)
- Rough styling (.css)
- "Heart" icon images

## Deliverable
- A fully functional game as described in instruction. Javascript is used to make game mechanics work.
